## How to look at the report
1. Clone or download this repo:
 git clone https://github.com/akoenen/sleep-lifestyle-bi.git
 cd sleep-lifestyle-bi
2. Open Sleep_Lifestyle_Final_Alejandro.pbix in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the pages and slicers to:
 - Compare sleep hours across different jobs and shifts
 - Look at lifestyle habits (screen time, exercise, etc.)
 - See how those factors line up with sleep quality
The PBIX is already wired up to the CSVs in the data folder, so you shouldn’t have to reconnect anything.

## Why I picked this project
I chose this for my portfolio because it shows the full BI workflow: finding data, cleaning it, building a star style model, and then turning it into a story with visuals. It also ties back to real life and how students and workers sleep, how our schedules affect us, and where habits might be hurting or helping our rest.
